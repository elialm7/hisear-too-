# HiSear tool

This software is a tool where you can save your links of websites you have visited,
and want to read, or read, etc so you don't save in a plain text file.

why not!? My whole point with this project was to have fun and also try to use technologies such as
sqlite, git branches, jira for software management, junit for testing, and jenkin for ci/cd.
